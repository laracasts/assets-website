                    Whenever I design, I feel at home. I guess it’s that feeling
                    of being able to create something from scratch that really
                    gives you the feeling of belonging. I think many in the
                    industry understand this and I’ve always been defined and
                    pushed by this. The joy of being able to help others is what
                    amplifies this creative journey and I believe that all of
                    the things that have defined who I am in life can be
                    expressed through design.

                    Eventually you reach a point where almost everything becomes
                    so clear that you just want to go back to the roots and
                    restart your own game while keeping all of the stats and
                    enjoying every step of the way all over again. #levelup
